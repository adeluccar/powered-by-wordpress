# Powered By WordPress

About 25% of the web is powered by WordPress. A big majority of these sites are private blogs but also heavy-weights such as [Sony Mobile](http://www.sonymobile.com) or [Mercedes Benz](https://www.mercedes-benz.com) use WordPress. 

Nonetheless, there are voices claiming that WordPress would not be suitable for professional websites beyond blogs. 
Here is a growing collection of currently 57 high-quality sites to counter this impression.

The notion is `Name (Alexa Ranking)`. `(N/A, Parent's Ranking)` is used for Alexa Ranking when the WordPress instance is in a subdirectory or subdomain and Alexa outputs the parent's ranking. Parent ranking must be in the global TOP 1 million.

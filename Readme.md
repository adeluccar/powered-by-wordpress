# Powered By WordPress

About 25% of the web are powered by WordPress. Most of it are private blogs but also heavy-weights such as [The New Yorker](http://www.newyorker.com/) or [TechCrunch](http://techcrunch.com/). But there is the claim that WordPress is not suitable for professional websites beyond blogs. Here is a collection of currently about 30 high-quality sites to counter this impression.

This list was originally based on a blog posts on [WinningWP](http://winningwp.com/examples-of-big-name-brands-and-businesses-using-wordpress/). It has been updated and extended with new sites and Alexa rankings.

You can contribute to this list via submitting an Issue with the subject `Add:` or correct a wrong entry with `Fix:`. Pull requests are also welcomed. Please double check each entry using [`Wappalyzer`](http://www.wapalyzer.com) (either with the browser PlugIn or [on the command-line](https://www.npmjs.com/package/wappalyzer-cli). Sites must have an TOP 1 million Alexa Ranking to be considered.

The notion is `Name (Alexa Ranking, Geography)`. `(N/A)` is used for Alexa Ranking when the WordPress instance is in a subdirectory or subdomain and Alexa outputs the parent's ranking. Parent ranking must be in the TOP 1 million.
